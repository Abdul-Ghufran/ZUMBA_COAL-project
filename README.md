# ZUMBA_COAL-project
A ZUMBA game made by me as a project by my institute. It uses irvine as a library in the assembly language for providing the graphics for the game and then the irvine commands are used for the functioning of those graphics.

The Zumba game is a tile-matching puzzle where players use a stationary cannon to shoot colored balls toward a moving chain, aiming to create chain reactions for high scores. The gameplay encourages strategic ball placement and timing to maximize points. Unlike traditional tile-matching games, balls aren't destroyed upon every match, allowing players to set up complex chain reactions for higher bonuses. Players progress through levels with increasing path complexity and speed.

Objective: Use strategic aiming to form chain reactions by aligning groups of matching-colored balls. Points are awarded based on chain bonuses and gap creation, rewarding delayed eliminations.
Controls: The player operates a cannon that can hold two balls, allowing them to switch between the two before shooting. Balls move along a visible path toward a danger zone, and players must align shots with others of the same color to score.

Instructions: Setup the irvine library using online youtube tutorial and then run the code file.
